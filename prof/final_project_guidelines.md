This is under construction.  I just wanted to get it started today.


- You will form groups of 3 (two of these) or 4 (one of these).
- Your group will work from a common data set, but you will do different projects with it.
- Thus, you will work together to identify, obtain, and clean the data.  Then you will work separately on the analysis & report.
- You are encouraged to discuss your projects with each other to get ideas and solve problems.  But you will be responsible for your own final product.
