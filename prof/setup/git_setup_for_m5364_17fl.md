My GitHub repo will be public so everyone can view it.  But your clone needs to be private so others can't see your homework solutions.  Here's how we do that:

- Give me your user name
- Confirm from link in your email to join Tarleton-Math.
- Create new *private* repo under Tarleton-Math organization name m5364_17fl_Data_Mining_yourlastname
- Follow instructions at https://medium.com/@bilalbayasut/github-how-to-make-a-fork-of-public-repository-private-6ee8cacaf9d3
